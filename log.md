# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Saturday June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on my Unity project with a friend for an hour and a half
  - Extended a bar location in-game to have a back room and pathway out
  - Created a 3D model of a table in Blender

**Thoughts** I'm getting better at creating interesting 3D environments for players to explore. I want to improve my Blender skills and read more of [Level Design - In Pursuit of Better Levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAlf2MwEFTwePwzbP3try1H0aYa9kpVBHPBkyIq-caY/)
