# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Saturday June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on my Unity project with a friend for an hour and a half; Extended a bar location in-game to have a back room and pathway out, Created a 3D model of a table in Blender.
Programs used: Blender, Unity

**Thoughts** I'm getting better at creating interesting 3D environments for players to explore. I want to improve my Blender skills and read more of [Level Design - In Pursuit of Better Levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAlf2MwEFTwePwzbP3try1H0aYa9kpVBHPBkyIq-caY/)

### Day 2: Sunday June 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a simple website that let's me choose an outfit from my wardrobe
Tech used: HTML/CSS and Bootstrap 4
Programs: Sublime Text, Chrome

**Thoughts**: I've always wanted an application that will let me do this, and I thought it would be good to start with a few 1 hour projects rather than the larger scale ideas I normally try to build.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a blog post about raycasting for the Pico-8, . Completed more modelling work in Blender, scene work in Unity, and asset creation in Aseprite.
Programs: Evernote, Unity, Blender, Aseprite

**Thoughts**: I've been going through this amazing article by [Lode Vandevenne](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) which contain a lot of concepts that make me excited about programming in general.

### Day 4: Tuesday June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Designing and adding more elements to [my webpage](https://www.mikeclark.xyz/). Also posted my first vlog to [lonely.dev](https://lonely.dev/) which took a lot more time than I thought it would.
Programs: Sublime Text, Chrome.

**Thoughts**: I wanted to add more elements to my webpage because at the moment it's a little bare. I want to make the external links more obvious, so it's easy to track my progress on multiple sites on the one page.
It was much harder to post a video to lonely.dev than I thought, but I'm long overdue to start posting videos there. I'm proud that I could do it, hopefully I can keep the vlogs going.
