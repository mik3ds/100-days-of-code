# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Saturday June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on my Unity project with a friend for an hour and a half; Extended a bar location in-game to have a back room and pathway out, Created a 3D model of a table in Blender.
Programs used: Blender, Unity

**Thoughts** I'm getting better at creating interesting 3D environments for players to explore. I want to improve my Blender skills and read more of [Level Design - In Pursuit of Better Levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAlf2MwEFTwePwzbP3try1H0aYa9kpVBHPBkyIq-caY/)

### Day 2: Sunday June 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a simple website that let's me choose an outfit from my wardrobe
Tech used: HTML/CSS and Bootstrap 4
Programs: Sublime Text, Chrome

**Thoughts**: I've always wanted an application that will let me do this, and I thought it would be good to start with a few 1 hour projects rather than the larger scale ideas I normally try to build.

### Day 3: Monday June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a blog post about raycasting for the Pico-8, . Completed more modelling work in Blender, scene work in Unity, and asset creation in Aseprite.
Programs: Evernote, Unity, Blender, Aseprite

**Thoughts**: I've been going through this amazing article by [Lode Vandevenne](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) which contain a lot of concepts that make me excited about programming in general.

### Day 4: Tuesday June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Designing and adding more elements to [my webpage](https://www.mikeclark.xyz/). Also posted my first vlog to [lonely.dev](https://lonely.dev/) which took a lot more time than I thought it would.
Programs: Sublime Text, Chrome.

**Thoughts**: I wanted to add more elements to my webpage because at the moment it's a little bare. I want to make the external links more obvious, so it's easy to track my progress on multiple sites on the one page.
It was much harder to post a video to lonely.dev than I thought, but I'm long overdue to start posting videos there. I'm proud that I could do it, hopefully I can keep the vlogs going.

### Day 5: Wednesday June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A lot of minor changes on a Wordpress site for my job. CSS and plugin changes mostly.

**Thoughts**: I have mixed feelings about Wordpress, but I'm having a great time getting as much hands-on website building experience as I can get.

### Day 6: Thursday June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continue with the CSS and plugin changes as mentioned. Rewrote writers briefs and sourced a few more stock photos from Unsplash.

**Thoughts**: The site should be ready to launch next week, and depending on the plan from there, possibly integrating a Shopify store into the website.

### Day 7: Friday June 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Mobile testing for the Wordpress site! Which means everything was broken and I had to reposition many elements.

**Thoughts**: It's all coming together after a hard couple of weeks of work, looking to launch Monday if it gets the all clear from my higher ups.
On another note, feels great to have a week of coding openly under my belt.

### Day 8: Sunday June 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reading through Picozine #2 and following a 3D object rendering technique on a 2D console, Pico-8

**Thoughts**: I took my first day off from the challenge yesterday, which I definitely enjoyed.
I'm very interested in the concept of 3D rendering on low powered machines. Not sure where I'm going heading down this route but I'm having a good time parsing the algorithms.

### Day 10: June 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Wordress - Dealing with Main Menu and submenu organization and CSS changes, and formatting the content currently on the site.

**Thoughts**: My website design was approved today, which is great because I was worried that all this work would be for nothing if the clients are not a fan of the design.

### Day 11: July 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 95 old posts ported over and formatted properly for the new template. Writers briefs worked on, and more Pico-8 blog writing

**Thoughts**: Been working very hard at my job lately, not a lot to show for it until this site launches! Which was supposed to be a week ago. Ah well, still learning a lot.

### Day 13: July 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a Weather app for Kotlin as part of a coding challenge.

**Thoughts**: Great to be back dealing with mobile apps, hopefully I can continue to build my Kotlin portfolio over the next few weeks. A lot more interesting to me than Wordpress work.

### Day 15: July 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: [Site is now live!](https://www.crystalworld.com.au/)

**Thoughts**: I thought it wasnâ€™t ready to go live, but the old site was broken, had no SSL, and didn't represent the company well.
For this site, I only saw what was broken, but my manager only sees what has been improved.
Very happy with how it has all turned out. Excited to have a site live, and nervous because I want to clean up all the mistakes!

### Day 16: July 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up a staging environment for the website, worked through minor todos and pushed to main site. 

**Thoughts**: I accidentally changed the logo on the live site without changing the dimensions, so the staging environment was born from that.

### Day 17: July 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Writing a python script to extract the content from 1800+ pages and convert them into a #wordpress posts import file

**Thoughts**: The pages I'm porting oer were written in the early 2000's and added in batches, so there is no continuity in the way things are layed out or images are linked. There are a lot of edge cases here.


### Day 18: July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Python script, began porting over content. Using sed to clear lines from html files that are unimportant first, then running the script in a folder to generate a list of items in an XML, and finally putting that into a WP posts import template. From there, Post ID's and URLs can be randomized.

**Thoughts**: Pretty happy about the solution I've come up with. The data is so different between each page that even cutting my work down by 90%-95% would be ideal. I don't need to tinker with the script for another week for it to be perfect when I can just scrub the data up in a day after running the script as is.
